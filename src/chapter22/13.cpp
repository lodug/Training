//a simple smart pointer example:

#include <iostream>
#include <memory> // for std::unique_ptr

class Resource
{
public:
	Resource() { std::cout << "Resource acquired\n"; }
	~Resource() { std::cout << "Resource destroyed\n"; }
};

int main()
{
	// allocate a Resource object and have it owned by std::unique_ptr
	std::unique_ptr<Resource> res{ new Resource() };

	return 0;
} // res goes out of scope here, and the allocated Resource is destroyed\

//std::unique_ptr

//std::unique_ptr is the C++11 replacement for std::auto_ptr. 
//It should be used to manage any dynamically allocated object that is not shared by multiple objects. That is, std::unique_ptr should completely own the object it manages, not share that ownership with other classes. std::unique_ptr lives in the <memory> header.
//Because the std::unique_ptr is allocated on the stack here, it’s guaranteed to eventually go out of scope, and when it does, 
//it will delete the Resource it is managing.

//Unlike std::auto_ptr, std::unique_ptr properly implements move semantics.
