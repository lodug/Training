//the member functions can be marked as deleted in the derived class, which ensures they canâ€™t be called at all through a derived object:
//the getValue() function was deleted
//This means that the compiler will complain when we try to call the derived version of the function. 
//Note that the Base version of getValue() is still accessible though. We can call Base::getValue() in one of two ways
