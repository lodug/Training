Task 10: sa porteze partea de build catre cmake pentru unul din taskurile implementate anterior (taskul cu cele mai multe fisiere).

- did it for Task1/subtask3

Steps:

in Task10 directory I created the:

- src directory (with the source files)
- include directory (with the header files) 
- CMakeLists.txt file -  the file that contains instructions for building my project with cmake

1.  in src directory: 

    g++ main.cpp automobil.cpp masina1.cpp masina2.cpp -o executable

    ./executable

2. BUild the project with cmake:

in Task10 directory:

- create the directory: build_directory

    mkdir build_directory
    cd build_directory

- from the build_directory run:
 
    cmake ..

- build the project using make tool:

    make

- the project was built and the "executable" executable found in the build_directory

- run the executable and see if the output is correct

    ./executable
