//Task 7: sa se implementeze un bash script care la start-up sa porneasca serveul si cleintul implementate in taskul 5 . 
//Scriptul trebuie apelat in mod automat la start-up de sistemul de operare.

For the task5/sockets, I have written the following script:

1. startAutomatically.sh
2. in this script I added the commands that compile the server.cpp and client.cpp
NOTE: added the "mv" command because when closing the virtual machine, after opening it again
and the terminal, the directory is home/projectx and I wanted that the executables and 
the output files to be in the folder for Task7: ~/Practice/C++/Training/Task/Task7/StartAutomatically/
4. in order to be run automatically, I added the script in the .bashrc file 
- cd ~ 
ls -la
nano file .bashrc 
5. in the file .bashrc, I added at the end my script:

#run my script for server client  task
~/Practice/C++/Training/Task/Task7/StartAutomatically/startAutomatically.sh

6. ctrl x to save it

7. close the virtual machine

8. open it again and open the terminal

9.the script has been run automatically, the files were generated
